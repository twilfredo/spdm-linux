What:		/sys/devices/.../authenticated
Date:		June 2024
Contact:	Lukas Wunner <lukas@wunner.de>
Description:
		This file contains 1 if the device authenticated successfully
		with SPDM (Security Protocol and Data Model).  It contains 0 if
		the device failed authentication (and may thus be malicious).

		Writing "re" to this file causes reauthentication.
		That may be opportune after updating the device keyring.
		The device keyring of the PCI bus is named ".cma"
		(Component Measurement and Authentication).

		Reauthentication may also be necessary after device identity
		has mutated, e.g. after downloading firmware to an FPGA device.

		The file is not visible if authentication is unsupported
		by the device.

		If the kernel could not determine whether authentication is
		supported because memory was low or communication with the
		device was not working, the file is visible but accessing it
		fails with error code ENOTTY.

		This prevents downgrade attacks where an attacker consumes
		memory or disturbs communication in order to create the
		appearance that a device does not support authentication.

		The reason why authentication support could not be determined
		is apparent from "dmesg".  To re-probe authentication support
		of PCI devices, exercise the "remove" and "rescan" attributes.
